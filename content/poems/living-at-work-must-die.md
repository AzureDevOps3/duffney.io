Always-on is great for databases but not for you. 

Yet, you emit a constant green status icon. You promptly open and refresh your inbox on an interval so frequent and consistent that the behavior is indistinguishable from a bot. You treat direct messages like the closing of a million-dollar deal, replying with the utmost haste. 

You avoid offline and away status because responsiveness is rewarded above performance, driving you to constantly pull for information. You're plugged in, but not productive. Feeling obligated, you pour what was once commute time into work. It feels justified because in the absence of in-person interaction, there is an instinct to connect. 

You yearn for a direct message. An email that was once a foe has become your friend. But it's your instinct to connect and the expectation of a real time response are at the core of why you're unproductive. 

The chaos of a busy office has been transplanted into the virtual world. But without the walls of an office to confine it, you're left defenseless without boundaries.

Without those boundaries, maintaining availability is unrealistic. Not only is it unrealistic, but it's also dangerous. Heather De-Quincey tweeted "I think we need to stop calling it 'working from home' and start calling it ‘living at work'". Is this how we want to live our lives? Do you want to put in more hours and be less productive? Or is it possible to be more productive with fewer hours?
