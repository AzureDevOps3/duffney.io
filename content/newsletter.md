# Tuesday's thoughts

Emails written to me and sent to you. Learn what I learn. 

Takes two minutes to read and leaves you thinking all day. Constrained by design. A single idea explored through three paragraphs and a single quote. Why? Because I value more than just your time. I value your attention.

Topics include; self-leadership, technology, deep work, and remote work.
