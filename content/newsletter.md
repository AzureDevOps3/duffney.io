# Tuesday's thoughts

You can't move forward without direction. And you won't progress without action. 

It's not about your time. It's about your attention. 

Takes two minutes to read and leaves you thinking all day. Constrained by design. A single idea explored through three paragraphs and a single quote. Why? Because I value more than just your time. I value your attention.

Topics include; self-leadership, technology, deep work, and remote work.
