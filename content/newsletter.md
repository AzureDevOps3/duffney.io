# Tuesday's thoughts

I write a weekly email, Tuesday’s Thoughts. Where I share how I stay in the driver’s seat of my career. I only share the most valuable lessons I’ve learned, as I learn them. 

Each email takes two minutes to read. Constrained by design to a single idea explored through three paragraphs and a single quote. 

You can't move forward without direction. And you won't progress without action. It's not about your time, it's about your attention.
