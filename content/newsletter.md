# Tuesday's thoughts

You can't move forward without direction. And you won't progress without action. 

It's not about your time. It's about your attention. 

Writing is thinking. And teaching is the best way to learn. So, I write a weekly email titled _Tuesday's thoughts_. Join me as I explore the depths of remote work. And turn a career into a calling.
