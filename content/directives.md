# ------>The Duffney Directives<------
```
> Establish a habit of growth.
```
	
```
> Consistency matters. What you're consistent with matters more.
```

```
> Become comfortable being unproductive while learning.
```

```
> Contentment is not the same as complacency.
```

> When learning, make obtaining competence your only goal. 
>
> Only after you've become competent can you determine if mastery is worth pursuing.

---
> There is a suffering in complacency. Knowing you're not achieving your true potential bitters you.

```
> Learn enough to practice, practice until you understand.
``` 

```
> Enjoy the process of learning, rather than the outcome.
```

> _Look upon others to adjust your sights, dreams, and ambitions. Compare only to who you were yesterday._
>
>  _They are the compass, you are the ship._
>
>  _The only thing that matters is the distance you’ve traveled._

---

> Your future needs a direction, not an operating manual. Know where you want to go, not how to get there. Only through action can you discover how.

---
> Be careful with who you share ideas. Your ideas might create authority conflicts with their idols. And one must never compete with idols.

---
```
> You can only sell results, not ideas.
```

---

> You avoid offline and away status because responsiveness is rewarded above performance.

---

> People Don’t Just Notice You. Your work and potential will go mostly unnoticed unless you learn to promote yourself.

```
> Humble enough to avoid arrogance. Confident enough to influence.
```

---

> Ideas require preparation for intellectual battle. Never reveal them until you can engage, defend, and maneuver.

---

> Use the experiences of others to influence your decisions without making them for you. Their trials might be your triumph.
