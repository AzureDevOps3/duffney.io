One big idea - being in control and not controlled by technology - living  a life of presents in a digital world - how do you work in tech without becoming consumed by it - without becoming its consumer - living with technology without it consuming you

Welcome to my blog. I [write](/posts), present, teach, and tweet about; Automation, DevOps, Cloud, and how I'm building a business from for my career.

My blog is a collection of my work, curated resources, and ideas. Ideas I've used to improve my career, myself and my life. As you browse my digital home, you'll find content on; [PowerShell](/tags/powershell/), [Ansible](/tags/ansible), [Terraform](/tags/terraform), [DevOps](/tags/devops), [Career](/tags/career), [Cloud](/tags/cloud), and [digital minimalism](/tags/digital-minimalism).

When I need to escape the attention economy I disappear from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshduffney). But I'm always writing. And have been for over 200 days straight.

At my day job, Iâ€™m a Site Reliability Engineer [@StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/StackOverflow). I've documented my journey from sysadmin to SRE in a series of posts. [Doubling My Salary a PowerShell Story](/doubling-my-salary-a-powershell-story/), [Becoming a Craftsman](/becoming-a-craftsman), [What Matters Beyond the Salary](/what-matters-beyond-the-salary), and [You're an Engineer be an Engineer](/youre-an-engineer-be-an-engineer).

```
TL:DR

* Automation (PowerShell)
* Source Control (Git)
* Release Engineering (TeamCity, Octopus, GitHub Actions)
* Infrastructure as Code (DSC, Ansible, Terraform)
* Cloud (Azure & AWS)

7 Years of Learning in 5 Bullet points.

Technology has given me a career, not a job. I love what I do, but there's a catch. It's nearly impossible to avoid the clutches of an always-on, always connected mentality. Falling prey to that mentality has led me to burnout. 

To combat it, I focus on deep, meaningful work and practice digital minialism in order to [detach from distraction](/detaching-from-distraction) and live a life empowered by technology [not consumed](/the-digital-declutter) by it.
