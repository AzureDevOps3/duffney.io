One big idea - being in control and not controlled by technology - living  a life of presents in a digital world - how do you work in tech without becoming consumed by it - without becoming its consumer - living with technology without it consuming you

Welcome to my blog. I [write](/posts), present, teach, and tweet about; DevOps, Cloud, and how to work in technology without being consumed by it.

In my day job, I’m a Site Reliability Engineer [@StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/StackOverflow). Working in technology is fast paced and ever changing. That’s why I treat my career as a business. A business dedicated to always learning and always sharing.

I write a weekly email, _Tuesday's Thoughts_. Where I share how I stay in the driver's seat of my career. I only share the most valuable lessons I've learned, as I learn them.

My blog is a collection of my work, curated resources, and ideas. Ideas I've used to improve my career, myself and my life. As you browse my digital home, you'll find content on; [PowerShell](/tags/powershell/), [Ansible](/tags/ansible), DevOps, [Career](/tags/career), Cloud, [deep work](/tags/deep-work), and digital minimalism.

I've documented my journey from sysadmin to SRE in a series of posts. [Doubling My Salary a PowerShell Story](/doubling-my-salary-a-powershell-story/), [Becoming a Craftsman](/becoming-a-craftsman), [What Matters Beyond the Salary](/what-matters-beyond-the-salary), and [You're an Engineer be an Engineer](/youre-an-engineer-be-an-engineer).

Technology has given me a career, not a job. I love what I do, but there's a catch. It's nearly impossible to avoid the clutches of an always-on, always connected mentality. Falling pray to that mentality has led me to burnout. 

To combat it, I focus on deep, meaningful work and practice digital minialism in order to [detach from distraction](/detaching-from-distraction) and live a life empowered by technology [not consumed](/the-digital-declutter) by it.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshduffney), where all my ideas start.
