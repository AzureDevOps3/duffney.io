A career in technology is fast paced. With new things to learn everyday. It's what I love about it, but sometimes it's hard to keep up. That's why outside of work, I run my career as a business.

I write about in my weekly emails, Tuesday's Thoughts. I only share the most valuable lessons I've learned, as I learn them.
