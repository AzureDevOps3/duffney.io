**Applies to: Windows PowerShell 2.0+**

Sometimes when you enter commands into PowerShell they don't execute the same way as they would in the command prompt. I ran into this issue with an uninstall string for a security software called Cylance Protect. The uninstall string looks like this:

```powershell
msiexec /Lvx* c:\Temp\MsiUnInstall.log /x {2E64FC5C-9286-4A31-916B-0D8AE4B22954} /qn
```

When I executed it within the command prompt it ran as expected, however when executed in PowerShell it pulled up the msi info page. The way I resolved this was by using cmd C\ followed by my uninstall command. The below code demonstrates this. Long story short use cmd /C "Command" to run cmd commands inside a PowerShell script.

# Run CMD commands in PowerShell

```powershell
cmd /c "msiexec /Lvx* c:\Temp\MsiUnInstall.log /x {2E64FC5C-9286-4A31-916B-0D8AE4B22954} /qn"
```

## Filepath has spaces

```powershell
cmd /c "`"C:\Program Files\Sophos\Endpoint Defense\SEDcli.exe`" -TPoff $tamperpassword"
```
